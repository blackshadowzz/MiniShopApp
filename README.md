About our app 
<br/>
We are developing a web application integrated with the Telegram Mini App platform, designed to streamline online ordering for restaurants and food vendors. While currently in testing, the app already supports essential features like menu browsing and placing orders. Weâ€™re actively refining performance and fixing minor issues to ensure a smooth and engaging experience for users within Telegram.

Our goal is to provide a seamless and efficient ordering experience, allowing users to easily navigate menus and place orders directly through Telegram.
